            <p>
                There is no shortage of options when it comes to text editors.
                I'll limit this list to the three most popular that are available
                for all major platforms (Mac, Windows, &amp; Linux).
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a rel="external" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a>
                    (currently on version 3) is by far the most popular text editor. It's
                    clean, simple, and has a huge community and plugin library. Free to
                    try (at the moment), $70 for a license.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a rel="external" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> is rather new on
                    the scene, and is very comparable to Sublime Text. Free!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a rel="external" href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> is another
                    up and coming text editor that provides a bit more integrated
                    features than Sublime Text and Atom. Free!

            <h3 class="h3">Testing in IE</h3>

            <p>
                As a developer, IE is probably not your browser of choice. However, usage
                rate is still very high. Any website you ship must be tested in IE.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're not on a Windows machine, testing old(er) versions
                of IE is going to be a little inconvenient. You'll
                need to set up some virtualization software and actually
                <em>install</em> multiple versions of Windows.
                <a rel="external" href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a>,
                <a rel="external" href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">Parallels</a>,
                and <a rel="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
                are all good virtualization options.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, head to
                <a rel="external" href="https://www.modern.ie/virtualization-tools#downloads">modern.IE</a>
                and download all the virtual machines you think you'll need. It's pretty safe to start
                with IE 9, 10, &amp; 11. Depending on the project/client, you may need to grab IE 8 as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to virtual machines, Microsoft offers a
                <a rel="external" href="https://remote.modern.ie/">remote testing service</a>
                that's a bit less involved than installing virtual machines. As of this writing,
                the remote service only offers IE 11 Technical Preview. Hopefully they'll offer
                additional IE versions through this service in the near future.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3">Other Browsers</h3>

            <p>
                <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_%28web_browser%29" title="Can you even download Safari from a URL? I guess not, huh?">Safari</a>
                is rather widely used and should be tested (if you have access to OS X).
                <a rel="external" href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> is not terribly
                popular. I almost never test in it, and I've never had a client or user
                report Opera bugs. Opera uses the
                <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_%28layout_engine%29">Blink
                rendering engine</a>, developed by Google and used in Chrome. If your site
                works in Chrome, it's safe enough (these days) to assume it works in Opera
                as well.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3">Touch Browsers</h3>

            <p>
                Browsers on phones and tablets obviously cannot be ignored. They are generally
                too numerous and varied to realistically test on all. You can usually get away
                with testing only one of the major platforms: Android (Chrome &amp; Firefox) and
                iOS (Safari &amp; Chrome). If you can afford it, get a phone and a tablet to test
                your
                <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive
                breakpoints</a>. If not, you can get by with just a phone.

            <h2 class="h2">Version Control</h2>

            <p>
                What is version control, anyway? In short, it's a way to manage changes to
                your project's source code. The concepts can be a little tricky, but most
                development teams (and even individuals) find it indispensable. The primary
                benefits of version control are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tracking changes to each file, meaning if you mess something up, you
                    can easily go back to the last working version.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ability for multiple developers to work in tandem and (often painlessly)
                    merge their changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Easily revert code changes that introduce bugs or errors.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The most popular version control software today is
                <a rel="external" href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
                <a rel="external" href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>,
                while not as popular as it once was, is still rather widely used as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most teams put their Git repositories (which hold all project code)
                online for easy sharing and viewing.
                <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is by far the most
                popular Git host, but
                <a rel="external" href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is also
                highly regarded.
            </p>

            <p>
                It may not make sense to dive in to the world of version control right away.
                However, you should
                <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/">create a GitHub account</a>
                straight away.
                (Many companies will ask for your GitHub URL during the application process.)
