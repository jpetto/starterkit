        <p>
            There is no shortage of options when it comes to text editors.
            I'll limit this list to the three most popular that are available
            for all major platforms (Mac, Windows, &amp; Linux).
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <a rel="external" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a>
                (currently on version 3) is by far the most popular text editor. It's
                clean, simple, and has a huge community and plugin library. Free to
                try (at the moment), $70 for a license.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a rel="external" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> is rather new on
                the scene, and is very comparable to Sublime Text. Free!
            </li>
            <li>
                <a rel="external" href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> is another
                up and coming text editor that provides a bit more integrated
                features than Sublime Text and Atom. Free!
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="h3">Testing in IE</h3>

        <p>
            As a developer, IE is probably not your browser of choice. However, usage
            rate is still very high. Any website you ship must be tested in IE.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're not on a Windows machine, testing old(er) versions
            of IE is going to be a little inconvenient. You'll
            need to set up some virtualization software and actually
            <em>install</em> multiple versions of Windows.
            <a rel="external" href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a>,
            <a rel="external" href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">Parallels</a>,
            and <a rel="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
            are all good virtualization options.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, head to
            <a rel="external" href="https://www.modern.ie/virtualization-tools#downloads">modern.IE</a>
            and download all the virtual machines you think you'll need. It's pretty safe to start
            with IE 9, 10, &amp; 11. Depending on the project/client, you may need to grab IE 8 as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to virtual machines, Microsoft offers a
            <a rel="external" href="https://remote.modern.ie/">remote testing service</a>
            that's a bit less involved than installing virtual machines. As of this writing,
            the remote service only offers IE 11 Technical Preview. Hopefully they'll offer
            additional IE versions through this service in the near future.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3">Other Browsers</h3>

        <p>
            <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_%28web_browser%29" title="Can you even download Safari from a URL? I guess not, huh?">Safari</a>
            is rather widely used and should be tested (if you have access to OS X).
            <a rel="external" href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> is not terribly
            popular. I almost never test in it, and I've never had a client or user
            report Opera bugs. Opera uses the
            <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_%28layout_engine%29">Blink
            rendering engine</a>, developed by Google and used in Chrome. If your site
            works in Chrome, it's safe enough (these days) to assume it works in Opera
            as well.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3">Touch Browsers</h3>

        <p>
            Browsers on phones and tablets obviously cannot be ignored. They are generally
            too numerous and varied to realistically test on all. You can usually get away
            with testing only one of the major platforms: Android (Chrome &amp; Firefox) and
            iOS (Safari &amp; Chrome). If you can afford it, get a phone and a tablet to test
            your
            <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive
            breakpoints</a>. If not, you can get by with just a phone.

    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="h2">Version Control</h2>

        <p>
            What is version control, anyway? In short, it's a way to manage changes to
            your project's source code. The concepts can be a little tricky, but most
            development teams (and even individuals) find it indispensable. The primary
            benefits of version control are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Tracking changes to each file, meaning if you mess something up, you
                can easily go back to the last working version.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ability for multiple developers to work in tandem and (often painlessly)
                merge their changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Easily revert code changes that introduce bugs or errors.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The most popular version control software today is
            <a rel="external" href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
            <a rel="external" href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>,
            while not as popular as it once was, is still rather widely used as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most teams put their Git repositories (which hold all project code)
            online for easy sharing and viewing.
            <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is by far the most
            popular Git host, but
            <a rel="external" href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is also
            highly regarded.
        </p>

        <p>
            It may not make sense to dive in to the world of version control right away.
            However, you should
            <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/">create a GitHub account</a>
            straight away.
            (Many companies will ask for your GitHub URL during the application process.)
